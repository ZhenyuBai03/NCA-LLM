I created a shared folder on dropbox for this project. You can use your own systems or github for development, but make sure they are private (make your github repository private). I will not use github but you can use it within your team and only upload milestone versions of the code and results to dropbox. More details will be explained in meeting today (3:30pm as always). Please test if the link is properly set up by uploading the code and results you have so far. For that purpose, please create a folder within the shared calm directory called "version1". Here is the dropbox link. Anyone with this link can edit. Please DO NOT share this link outside the research group.
